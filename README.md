# INTRODUCTION

This project takes a look at data from different crowdfunding platforms in Turkey. By analysing the different columns, I will try to make an inference on what influences success in crowdfunding projects. After variable and cluster analysis, I will build models that predict the success of a project, which is accomplished if the project met the funding target.


# HYPOTHESIS

The main hypothesis is that the digital space: social media reach and websites, have a positive influence in a project’s success.
